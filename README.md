This portal selling tool allows for a number of functions.

-   When we match against keywords we don't just look for common phrases (although we do this first for speed), we also break the sentence down into three separate entities (removing the filler words in the process) and analyse each part independently. It could be the user has given us an Intent (I want to buy) and a Service (a Portal) but hasn't specified a Destination, because of this we'll request one with our initial message to the player.
-   Automation should be at a point where you just have to hit "Remove" on the player's ticket to remove them from the group as well as accepting any tips you may receive via trade confirmations.
-   You can configure separate "Intent", "Destination" and "Service" category keywords.
-   Add players to your custom Ban list./
-   Configure the messages sent to customers at each step of the process.
